Development plan
================

* Add an `architecture description <https://matklad.github.io/2021/02/06/ARCHITECTURE.md>`_
* Reconsider header file naming, "midi" word repeats several times
* Check if it's possible to feed "bytes_to_data" malformed values (probably not, because note byte has a fixed range of values)
* Document examples
* Think more about the uses of structs and unions (current topics I used: "`Structure within union in C <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21442600/>`_", "`How to access a struct member inside a union in C <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12653500/>`_")
